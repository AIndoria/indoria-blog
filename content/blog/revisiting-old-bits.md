**Project 1 : SelfControl**

Now, I've found quite a list of visualization tools in the past week or so, which means that I have a lot of tools to play around with, and not so much time. Hence, until I've finalized the visualizations I'll be using on my site, I'm putting this on hold. Should only be about a week or so at most. Not to mention sanitizing the damn csv files I get is extremely annoying work because I haven't had time to automate the dataframes just yet.

**Project 2: SPQR**

I don't think I've ever mentioned it, but one of the projects I quited liked was [this Government portal I was making for the Republic of Rome](https://github.com/AIndoria/ResPublicaRomana/) set in 66 AD (I think). I absolutely love Roman history, and I like to think that I'm fairly competent at it, so I'll be working on finishing it before I move on to my COVID-19 project.
It just needs a few things done, such as fixes to responsive design (right now everything's left on the mercy of css-grid and flexbox), adding Offices and Province maps, and implementing a search/login feature for Petitions and such.
How else would you get the Senate to say no to you and declare you a public enemy?
